THanks for stoppying by, This is my first github so you will see alot of projects. I am becoming a Red team expert and most of my project will be geared towards Red team operations 
and or business type solutions for every day problems. When you cant afford a UMS or need programming to fill in the gaps then you might find what you need here. I am no expert but I do have 
enough knowleged to create something out of nothing (Hello world!! lol). Please feel free to leave comments and suggestions.
